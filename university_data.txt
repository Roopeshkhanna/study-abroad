 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 92 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 98 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.In addition to the aid reported, these students also received $1.352 million in grants from other sources in 22-23. If this aid were included, the average net price across Title IV students would decrease by $3,130.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorcollege.harvard.edu/financial-aid/net-price-calculator

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/how/calculator/index.html?tab=net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 86 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmissions.yale.edu/estimate-your-cost

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 99 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorcollegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/costs/calculate

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 88 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/jhu

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 77 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/upenn

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 77 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.finaid.caltech.edu/npc

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 98 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/duke

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 97 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/northwestern

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 86 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmissions.dartmouth.edu/afford/estimate-your-cost

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 92 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/app/brown

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 75 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

At this institution, 85 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.rice.edu/calculate-my-cost

It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 96 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/app/cornell

Johnson College of Business (Dyson School, Nolan School) do not consider scores in making admissions decisions, even if students submit them.

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 83 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.nd.edu/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 92 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.berkeley.edu/how-aid-works/estimate-your-financial-aid/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 70 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmission.ucla.edu/tuition-aid/net-cost-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 64 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/app/emory

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 64 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/app/umich

If an institution reports less than 5 students for any of the test scores, percentiles are not reported.The UM admissions process considers all parts of a student's record and experience; it does not admit applicants solely on the basis of a particular GPA, test score, or other single criterion. UM converts fi rst-year applicant GPA to an unweighted 4.0 scale for classes from grades 9-11. Only the absolute value of the grade is used (A+ or A or A- = 4.0). We review the number of demanding courses separately. A portfolio is required for Art, Architecture and Ross Business School applicants.Admission to the UM is competitive. As such, scores on standardized tests may seem high. However, the individualized, comprehensive process used to review each application provides pathways to admission for students with different strengths and contributions to offer.

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 82 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/virginia

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 80 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/unc

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 81 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.usc.edu/npc

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 70 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/app/ufl

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 77 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/net-price-calculator.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 80 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinaid.ucsb.edu/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 72 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.ofas.uci.edu/content/Calculator.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 70 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfas.ucsd.edu/forms-and-resources/financial-aid-estimator/index.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 68 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorosfa.uga.edu/sites/default/files/npcalc.htm

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 75 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.onestop.utexas.edu/managing-costs/cost-tuition-rates/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 80 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/bc

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 88 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.wisc.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 79 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorsecure.osfa.illinois.edu/NPC/NPC.asp

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 80 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorseaver.pepperdine.edu/admission/financial-aid/undergraduate/npc

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 86 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution.

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorcollegenpc.com/UniversityofMiami

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 74 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorsfa.osu.edu/incoming-freshmen/about-aid/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 68 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 2017Interpret data with caution. At The Ohio State University, students can change campuses and earn degrees while attending a campus other than their original campus. Mobility among campuses is not uncommon. Students changing campuses are reported as “transfer out” at the cohort campus even if they graduate from the university. This lowers graduation rates and increases transfer rates, particularly at regional campuses, where students often change to Columbus.6-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramInterpret data with caution. At The Ohio State University, students can change campuses and earn degrees while attending a campus other than their original campus. Mobility among campuses is not uncommon. Students changing campuses are reported as “transfer out” at the cohort campus even if they graduate from the university. This lowers graduation rates and increases transfer rates, particularly at regional campuses, where students often change to Columbus.

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16Interpret data with caution.

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatortuition.psu.edu/CostEstimate.aspx

State’s application allows students to choose both a first choice and an
alternative campus which gives students the best change of joining the
Penn State family.

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 95 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.purdue.edu/dfa/cost/calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 88 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorscarlethub.rutgers.edu/financial-services/tools-resources/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 77 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.uconn.edu/pricecalc/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 85 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.washington.edu/financialaid/getting-started/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 67 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornetprice.app.clemson.edu/calc/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 74 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.fordham.edu/undergraduate-financial-aid/financing-your-fordham-education/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 86 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 85 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 83 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.umd.edu/resources-policies/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 76 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorpitt.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 44 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.wpi.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/financial-need/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 92 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

 Net PriceAverage Net Price for Full-Time Beginning StudentsFull-time beginning undergraduate students who paid the in-state or in-district tuition rate and were awarded grant or scholarship aid from federal, state or local governments, or the institution.2020-20212021-20222022-2023Average net price$17,468$16,018$16,730Full-time beginning undergraduate students who paid the in-state or in-district tuition rate and were awarded Title IV aid by income.Average net price by Income2020-20212021-20222022-2023$0 – $30,000$6,720$6,933$7,262$30,001 – $48,000$8,356$7,032$7,634$48,001 – $75,000$11,603$10,850$10,861$75,001 – $110,000$18,140$18,380$17,909$110,001 and more$24,979$25,233$26,623Average net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state/local government, or institutional grant or scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance. Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies, and the weighted average for Food and Housing and other expenses.Beginning students are those who are entering postsecondary education for the first time.Title IV aid to students includes grant aid, work study aid, and loan aid. These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmissions.tc.umn.edu/cost-aid/cost-aid-scholarships/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 44 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatortuition.tamu.edu/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 71 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.american.edu/financialaid/Net-Price-Calculator-Form.cfm

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 84 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.baylor.edu/sfs/netpricecalculator/npcalc.htm

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 91 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.clarku.edu/offices/financial-aid/prospective-students/u-s-students/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 92 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution.

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorir.mines.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 89 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.udel.edu/apply/undergraduate-admissions/financing-your-degree/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 88 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornetpricecalc.tcnj.edu/netpricecalc/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 74 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorutulsa.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 75 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.umass.edu/net_price_calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 78 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatormsu.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 83 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants.

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 81 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.du.edu/financialaid/undergraduate/calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 72 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorofa.colorado.edu/NetPriceCalculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 80 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/indiana

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 92 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.uvm.edu/studentfinancialservices/net_price_calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 82 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.sandiego.edu/admissions/undergraduate/tuition-financial-aid/net-price-calculator.php

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 74 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution.

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.suny.edu/howmuch/netpricecalculator.xhtml?id=2&embed=n&headerUrl=www.binghamton.edu/npc/logo.png&cssUrl=www.binghamton.edu/np

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 79 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmissions.uiowa.edu/finances/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 79 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoryu.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 76 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution.

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.esf.edu/tuition-aid/financialaid/netprice.php

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 33 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoruc.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 74 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.ucdenver.edu/tuition-cost/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 44 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmissions.ku.edu/afford/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 73 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.uoregon.edu/net_price_calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 84 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.ou.edu/sfc/estimating-costs/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 68 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorarizona.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 65 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoronestop.utk.edu/your-money/cost-estimators/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 81 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.unl.edu/net-price-calculator

It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 82 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorua.aidcalc.cloud/netprice.htm

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 85 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.missouri.edu/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 81 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoruky.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 86 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorsc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/financial_aid/cost_and_aid/cost_to_attend/index.php

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 82 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.utah.edu/tuition-and-fees/cost-calculator.php

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 73 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoruc.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 74 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.buffalo.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 75 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinaid.ucf.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 47 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.uh.edu/financial/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 51 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorlouisville.edu/financialaid/net-price-calculator-1

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 71 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/unh

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 84 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorweb.uri.edu/ir/netprice-2/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 69 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinaid.olemiss.edu/calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 79 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinaid.uark.edu/aid-calculator.php

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 81 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.unr.edu/Prebuilt/financial-aid/net-price-calculator/index.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 52 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/student/app/unm

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 70 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfia.uncg.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 59 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.highered.texas.gov/apps/NPC/?Fice=003594

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 63 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.utoledo.edu/financialaid/NetPriceCalculator.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 60 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoruwm.edu/onestop/finances/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 63 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.uwyo.edu/sfa/net-price-calculator/index.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 62 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.usu.edu/admissions/costs-and-aid/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 72 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorsfs.vcu.edu/tuition-and-fees/estimate-your-tuition-and-fees/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates.

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorforms.financialaid.wsu.edu/cost-of-attendanceaid-estimator/npc/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 66 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 53 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 67 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwebapps.wichita.edu/netprice/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 34 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.wright.edu/raiderconnect/forms-and-resources/cost-estimator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 54 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinaid.umkc.edu/affordability/net-price-calculator.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 56 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.umsl.edu/sfs/calculator/index.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 28 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.umt.edu/finaid/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator/default.php

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 61 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwebapp.unomaha.edu/net-price-calculator/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 68 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorcashiering.unlv.edu/undergrad_calc.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 58 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorcalculator.charlotte.edu/npc/

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 63 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorund.edu/admissions/cost-and-aid/calculator.html

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 51 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.unco.edu/financial-aid/resources/net-price-calculator.aspx

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 67 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatoradmissions.uni.edu/financial-aid/resources/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 62 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.ou.edu/sfc/estimating-costs/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 68 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorfinancialaid.uoregon.edu/net_price_calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 84 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants.

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 76 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program(*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates.Bachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 86 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.redlands.edu/npc

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 56 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatornpc.collegeboard.org/app/richmond

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 91 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.rochester.edu/financial-aid/cost-calculators/#college-board

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 87 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16

These include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants, Federal Work-Study, Subsidized Direct Loans, and Unsubsidized Direct Loans. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.Net Price CalculatorAn institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending that institution for a particular student.Visit this institution's net price calculatorwww.usfca.edu/admission/financial-aid/net-price-calculator

 Retention and Graduation RatesFirst-to-Second Year Retention RatesRetention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2022 and Returned in Fall 2023Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out RateThe overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution without completing at the current institution.Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 77 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2023.Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their ProgramBachelor's Degree Graduation RatesBachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2015 or Fall 20176-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's DegreesPercentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2017 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program

 Outcome MeasuresAlternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students. These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants.  These measures provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.FULL-TIME, FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16FULL-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16PART-TIME, NON-FIRST-TIME DEGREE/CERTIFICATE-SEEKING UNDERGRADUATES WHO ENTERED IN 2015-16
